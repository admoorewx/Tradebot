# Tradebot
Tradebot is a stock trading algorithm that currently relies on Support Vector Regression to produce a 24-hour ensemble stock forecast for a variety of U.S.-based stocks. Additional ML algorithms will be explored in the future.

This tool uses a combination of the Alpaca API (https://alpaca.markets/) for brokerage purposes and the yfinance API (https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) to retrive stock data. 

Dependency requirements can be found in the trade_bot_env.txt file.
